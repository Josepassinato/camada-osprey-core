The trajectory chronicles an intense development and debugging cycle for an AI-powered immigration application tool. The work began with successfully debugging and deploying the Case Finalizer backend feature. However, the focus immediately shifted to a critical user-reported security vulnerability in the Dr. Miguel document analysis AI, which was incorrectly approving invalid documents. This led to a major refactoring effort, fixing deep-seated bugs in the Pydantic models, policy engine, and fallback logic within  and .

Following the security fix, the system was deemed too restrictive, prompting a pivot to integrate a professional third-party API. After a brief, aborted attempt with Onfido, a strategic decision was made to implement a hybrid system combining the Google Vision API for professional-grade OCR with the improved Dr. Miguel AI for intelligent validation. This phase was dominated by a complex series of authentication challenges, iterating through API keys, environment variable loading issues, and ultimately succeeding with a full OAuth2 implementation.

With the document validation system finally robust, secure, and functional, the project pivoted again to a new major feature request: the Agente Coruja (Owl Agent), an intelligent, guided questionnaire system designed to auto-fill official USCIS forms. The most recent actions involved acknowledging this new requirement and creating the initial backend file to begin implementation.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered, self-service platform designed to simplify the US immigration process for users.

**Core Features & Status:**
*   **Intelligent Document Validator:** Originally an in-house AI (Dr. Miguel), this system has been re-engineered into a robust hybrid model. It now uses the Google Vision API for high-accuracy Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and data extraction, feeding that structured data to the improved Dr. Miguel agent, which performs advanced validation, fraud detection, and consistency checks. The critical security flaw of approving invalid documents has been resolved.
*   **Interactive AI Cover Letter Module:** An AI persona (Dra. Paula) assists users in drafting and formatting their cover letters through an interactive Q&A workflow.
*   **Case Finalizer:** A fully functional backend module that audits the application, merges all documents into a master PDF, and generates final instructions.
*   **Agente Coruja (Owl Agent) - In Progress:** This is the next major feature. It will be an intelligent, friendly questionnaire presented in the user's native language. The Owl Agent will guide the user through the questions in real-time. Upon completion, the answers will be validated by a Google API, used to auto-fill the official English USCIS form, and then presented to the user for final approval before being saved to their case file.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** React (Vite) frontend with a Python FastAPI backend.
- **Database:** MongoDB for application data storage.
- **AI Integration:** A hybrid, multi-agent architecture. It uses the Google Vision API for professional OCR and an OpenAI-powered agent (Dr. Miguel) for contextual validation and analysis.
- **Authentication:** Implementation of both Google Cloud API Keys and a full OAuth2 flow (using ) to securely connect to Google Cloud services.
- **PDF Generation:** Utilizes libraries like  and  for the Case Finalizer feature.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with distinct  and  directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core FastAPI application, defining all API routes.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file underwent massive changes. The  endpoint was completely refactored multiple times to fix security flaws, and then to orchestrate the hybrid validation flow, calling the new Google Vision API module and then the specialized AI agent. The fix for loading environment variables with  at the top of the file was a critical change.

-   ** (New File)**
    -   **Importance:** This module encapsulates all logic for communicating with Google Cloud AI services.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created to handle OCR tasks. It was refactored multiple times to handle different Google APIs (Vision, Document AI) and authentication methods (API Key, OAuth2). It now successfully uses OAuth2 credentials to connect to the Google Vision API, with a fallback to mock data if the API is unavailable.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the core logic and system prompts for the AI agents, particularly Dr. Miguel.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Was heavily debugged to fix a critical  error. The system prompt for Dr. Miguel was significantly enhanced to perform more detailed, forensic-style analysis based on the structured data received from the Google Vision API.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains rule-based logic for document validation scoring.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Was made more robust by replacing direct dictionary key access () with the safer  method to prevent  crashes, which were a source of instability.

-   ** (New File)**
    -   **Importance:** This is the placeholder file created to house the backend logic for the new Agente Coruja feature.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Newly created and currently empty. It will be the focus of the next development phase.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Agente Coruja Feature:** Build the complete, multi-step workflow for the friendly questionnaire as requested by the user. This includes backend API development, frontend UI, AI-guided interaction, Google API validation, and auto-filling of official USCIS forms.
- **Fix  Bug:** A previously identified frontend bug, where selecting a visa type defaults to B-1/B-2, was superseded by the critical security issue and was never resolved.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus has shifted to implementing the new Agente Coruja (Owl Agent) feature. The previous, intensive work on debugging and re-architecting the document validation system is now complete, with the hybrid Google Vision API + Dr. Miguel solution successfully tested and running.

The user has provided a detailed set of requirements for the Owl Agent, which involves creating an interactive, multi-lingual questionnaire that guides the user, validates their input via a Google API, and then uses the data to automatically populate an official USCIS PDF form.

The very last actions taken were:
1.  Acknowledging the user's detailed request for this new feature.
2.  Performing a preliminary search of the codebase to identify existing related files (like ).
3.  Creating a new file, , to serve as the container for the backend logic of this new feature.

The project is at the starting point of this new development cycle.

<optional_next_step>
Begin implementing the backend for the Agente Coruja by creating the necessary API endpoints in  and developing the core business logic inside the new  module.
