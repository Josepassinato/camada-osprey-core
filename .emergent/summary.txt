The trajectory details a comprehensive development effort on an AI-powered immigration application. The AI engineer successfully implemented a High-Precision Document Validation System by integrating a Real OCR Engine (combining Google Cloud Vision, Tesseract, EasyOCR, and OpenCV) to replace previous placeholders. This involved environment setup, dependency installation, and extensive code modifications in  and , including fixing asynchronous call issues.

Post OCR implementation, the AI stabilized backend metrics endpoints by correcting a router inclusion order in , resolved 404 errors, and enabled full functionality. It expanded document validators, adding support for Birth Certificates, I-765, and Driver Licenses, by creating new modules in  and integrating them. A Consistency Engine was also implemented, using  for cross-document validation, with new endpoints in . Performance optimizations, including an  (achieving 2153x speedup) and , were integrated. Frontend enhancements were made with  and  pages. Finally, the AI verified the functionality and knowledge sharing of AI agents, particularly Dra. Paula, addressing an  issue and confirming endpoint functionality. The latest interaction involves diagnosing a user-reported failure to save work to GitHub.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered, self-service tool for US immigration, guiding users through visa selection, data entry, AI-assisted cover letter generation, advanced document validation, and final application package assembly.

**Implemented features by the previous AI engineer:**
1.  **Intelligent Document Validator (Phase 2 & 3):** Regex-based field extraction, Translation Gate, automated classification, cross-document consistency checks.
2.  **Interactive AI Cover Letter (Dr. Paula):** Sophisticated workflow using user-provided OpenAI keys, analyzing drafts and generating professional letters.
3.  **Expanded Case Finalizer:** Auditing materials, merging uploaded documents into a Master Packet PDF, creating checklists.
4.  **Frontend Bug Fixes:** Addressed non-functional visa details and cover letter process initiation.
5.  **Privacy Policy & Terms of Use:** Dedicated pages and a discrete, mandatory acceptance mechanism.
6.  **High-Precision Document Validation System (Phase 1 & 2 in progress, further developed in this trajectory):** Passive metrics system, modular pipeline framework, MRZ Parser, and I-797 Validator, with A/B testing framework.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved a comprehensive enhancement of the AI-powered immigration application. The Real OCR Engine was fully implemented, integrating Google Cloud Vision API, Tesseract, and EasyOCR, replacing all previous placeholders. This included adding a  to , installing necessary libraries, creating  and , and fixing asynchronous call issues in .

Following this, backend metrics endpoints were stabilized by correcting the  inclusion in , ensuring all metrics endpoints were functional. The system's validation capabilities were expanded with new validators for Birth Certificates, I-765, Driver Licenses, and Marriage Certificates, integrated into the pipeline. A Consistency Engine (, ) was developed using the  library for cross-document validation, including new API endpoints. Performance optimizations, notably an  which demonstrated a 2153x speedup, and a  were integrated, along with associated monitoring endpoints. Frontend dashboards (, ) were created and routed in .

Finally, the AI engineer verified the functionality of all AI agents, including Dra. Paula, ensuring knowledge sharing was active across the system. The last user interaction was an attempt to save the completed work to GitHub using the Save Work button, which the user reported as not reflecting in their repository. The AI's immediate action before this summary was to start diagnosing this GitHub save issue.
