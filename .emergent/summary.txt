The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines several significant enhancements and bug fixes for the OSPREY Immigration Platform. Initially, the focus was on improving the Intelligent Tutor system (backend logic, FastAPI endpoints, React component ) and enhancing document validation specificity in . A key decision was to address save form filling progress by exploring  and .

The most substantial and recurring issues involved the document analysis system. It was discovered that the native system was initially using simulated data, leading to inaccurate results. This prompted a refactor to implement real OpenAI Vision analysis, replacing the simulated logic. A critical bug related to using an  with budget issues instead of the user's  triggered a comprehensive removal of  dependencies across multiple backend files (, , ).

Throughout the trajectory, persistent deployment failures were encountered. The engineer methodically addressed issues like hardcoded URLs (, , , ), removed unused ML dependencies (), added crucial health check endpoints in , configured CORS, and made health checks more resilient to temporary MongoDB unavailability.

Finally, the engineer worked on user-requested improvements for document upload: adding processing indicators and a passport name option for data divergence. These features faced implementation challenges due to incorrect API endpoint calls,  field mismatches, and  availability issues, which were subsequently debugged and fixed. The trajectory concludes with a critical React Router failure preventing the  component from rendering, making the recently implemented features invisible to the user.

<product_requirements>
The platform is an AI-powered self-service tool for US immigration, guiding users from visa selection to package assembly. Initial features included native document validation, intelligent USCIS form filling with a Portuguese friendly form, AI completeness validation, and English conversion. A disclaimer system replaced AI Fraud Detection. Recent enhancements focused on a tutor agent with a 5-tab UI and OpenAI backend, and Comprehensive Production Readiness (API docs, Docker, CI/CD, k8s).

Current tasks in the trajectory included:
1.  **Save Form Filling Progress**: Implement and verify the functionality to save user progress on USCIS forms.
2.  **Document Analysis Precision**: Ensure the native document analysis system provides accurate, real-time results, moving from simulated data to OpenAI Vision, and exclusively using the user's OpenAI API key.
3.  **Deployment Reliability**: Fix issues preventing successful deployment, including hardcoded URLs, unnecessary ML dependencies, and robust health checks.
4.  **Document Upload User Experience**:
    *   Add a processing indicator during document upload.
    *   Provide an option to use passport data to correct initial registration in case of name/DOB divergence.
5.  **Official Form Flow**: Ensure the official form upload field is removed, as forms are auto-filled by AI after the friendly questionnaire and saved to the client's process folder.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React/Vite (frontend), Python/FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI/LLM**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o, Vision), native multimodal AI vision (OCR, data extraction).
-   **Web**: JWT (authentication), FastAPI routers, React routing, API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI), CORS.
-   **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes (k8s manifests), Supervisor, CI/CD (GitHub Actions).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively investigating a critical issue reported by the user: Ainda n√£o aparece as mudancas (the changes are still not appearing) (Chat 747). This refers to the two recently implemented features: the visual processing indicator during document uploads and the passport name option modal for correcting name/DOB divergence.

The last identified root cause is a **critical React Router failure** that is preventing the  component from rendering (Chat 750). This means that even if the underlying logic for the processing indicator and the passport name option is correct, the user cannot see or interact with them because the entire component that hosts these features is not being displayed.

Prior debugging efforts for these features included:
-   Correcting the API endpoint call in  from  to .
-   Fixing  field names in  to match backend expectations.
-   Ensuring the  function was correctly imported and utilized in .
-   Addressing an issue where the  was not available at the time of document upload requests in .
-   Improving the prompt in  for better analysis responses.
-   Removing temporary debug code (artificial delays, forced divergence) previously added for testing.
-   Multiple rounds of verifying and removing any misleading official form upload fields or labels from  and deleting old backup files ().
-   Confirming the automatic saving flow for official forms post-friendly questionnaire and AI filling, including saving to physical storage in .

The current state is that the backend logic and API calls for these features are believed to be correct and functional, but the frontend component responsible for rendering them is failing to load due to a router issue.
