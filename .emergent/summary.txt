<analysis>
The trajectory documents a rapid, multi-phase feature development cycle for an AI immigration application tool. The work began by acknowledging a new major feature request: the Agente Coruja (Owl Agent), an intelligent questionnaire system.

Development proceeded through several distinct, user-driven phases. Phase 1 involved building the core backend for the Owl Agent, creating API endpoints in  and the agent's logic in . Phase 2 focused on the frontend, where a testing agent built the UI but uncovered a critical routing bug, which was subsequently fixed by ensuring a  was passed correctly.

Phase 3 introduced a user-requested feature for saving progress, requiring the implementation of a simple email/password authentication system. This involved adding new auth endpoints to the backend and new React components to the frontend. This phase also surfaced and resolved a critical technical bug related to MongoDB  JSON serialization.

Phase 4 added a complete payment and finalization flow using Stripe, integrated via the  library. This included creating payment endpoints, frontend payment pages, and logic for downloading the final application package.

The most recent work, Phase 5, addresses a user query about connecting the application to their custom domain, . The last actions involved inspecting environment files and searching the codebase, confirming the application is currently configured for a preview domain. The immediate next step is to address this domain configuration request.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered platform to assist users with the US immigration process. The primary focus of the recent development has been the Agente Coruja (Owl Agent) feature.

**Agente Coruja - Intelligent Questionnaire:**
*   **Goal:** Guide users through a multi-lingual, friendly questionnaire to auto-fill official USCIS forms.
*   **Core Logic:** An AI (OpenAI GPT-5) provides real-time guidance, and user answers are validated.
*   **Progress Saving:** Users must be able to save their progress. This is implemented with two options:
    1.  **Continuous Navigation:** Progress is saved automatically for users who complete the form in one session.
    2.  **Save and Return:** Users can create a simple account (email/password) to save their session and return later.
*   **Finalization & Payment:** Upon completing the questionnaire, the user is directed to a payment page.
    *   **Payment:** Stripe is used for payment processing.
    *   **Delivery:** After successful payment, the user can either download the complete application package as a PDF or have it sent to their email.
*   **Data Privacy:** The system must inform users that their data is deleted after the package is downloaded/sent, ensuring privacy.

The overall goal is to provide a seamless, guided, and secure end-to-end experience for completing and obtaining immigration forms.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** React frontend and Python FastAPI backend.
- **Database:** MongoDB, with a critical fix implemented for  JSON serialization.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-5 (via  and ) for intelligent guidance.
- **Payment Processing:** Real Stripe integration managed via the  library.
- **Authentication:** A simple, custom-built email/password authentication system using  for password hashing.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Extensive use of  in the FastAPI backend for non-blocking database and API operations.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a  (React) and  (FastAPI) directory.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main FastAPI application file, defining all API routes, database connections, and startup/shutdown events.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file was heavily modified to add multiple new API routers for the Owl Agent. This includes endpoints for starting sessions (), user authentication (, ), managing sessions (, ), and handling payments (, ). A crucial helper function, , was added to fix MongoDB  serialization errors.

    

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the core business logic for the Owl Agent's questionnaire, including field definitions, guidance prompts, and validation rules.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The file was populated with extensive dictionaries defining form fields, their types, validation rules, and AI-powered guidance prompts, forming the brain of the questionnaire.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root component of the React application, responsible for defining the application's routing structure.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** New routes were added to handle the new pages for the Owl Agent flow, including , , and .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point page for the Owl Agent feature. It manages the user's state, determining whether to show the authentication/session selection screen or the questionnaire itself.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Integrated the  and  components to create a comprehensive landing page for the feature. It now handles logic for starting new sessions for anonymous or authenticated users.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These new pages handle the final step of the user journey.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**  was created to fetch a Stripe checkout session from the backend and redirect the user to Stripe.  is the landing page after a successful payment, providing download/email options and the privacy disclaimer.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new component created to handle user registration and login.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This component provides the UI form for new and returning users to create an account or log in to access their saved questionnaire sessions.

<pending_tasks>
- **Configure Custom Domain:** The user wants the application to be connected to . The current setup uses a preview URL ().
- **Fix  Bug:** An old, unresolved bug where selecting a visa type defaults to B-1/B-2 was mentioned in the initial project context but never addressed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate task is responding to the user's request to connect the application to their custom domain, . The previous engineer has already performed the initial investigation and confirmed that the application is not currently configured for this domain.

The last actions taken were:
1.  Reading the frontend environment configuration file: , which revealed .
2.  Reading the backend environment configuration file: .
3.  Searching the entire application for any references to the custom domain or the preview domain: .

This investigation confirmed the current URL configuration and established that no part of the codebase is hardcoded to the user's desired domain. The work is paused at the point of needing to formulate a plan to assist the user with the domain setup.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Explain to the user that the application is currently on a preview domain and outline the steps required to connect it to . This involves DNS configuration on their domain provider and updating environment variables.
