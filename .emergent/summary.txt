The AI engineer's work primarily focused on iteratively building and refining a B2C immigration self-application tool. Key efforts included implementing the 9-step auto-application journey, redesigning the landing page for minimalism and mobile responsiveness, and pivoting from a voice agent to a Proactive Owl Tutor. A significant recurring challenge was debugging frontend/backend URL mismatches ( vs. preview environment) and ensuring  persistence. Recent work saw the integration of a multi-agent AI system, leveraging an existing Dra. Paula B2C expert for enhanced document validation, form validation, letter generation, and USCIS form translation. The work then shifted to UI/UX refinements on the landing page and adding new visa types and responsibility confirmations. The immediate last task involved resolving a critical frontend error (yellow page on SelectForm) caused by recent modifications, leading to a rollback.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered self-application tool for immigration, assisting self-petitioners with US visa applications without providing legal advice. Its core is a 9-step AI-driven auto-application journey, from initial agreement (Comece Agora) through visa selection, basic data entry, document upload, storytelling, a friendly form (online completion only), visual review, payment, and final download/tutorial. Key features include AI assistance (via a proactive Osprey Owl Tutor providing guidance and deterministic validations), user authentication, document management (with AI verification and certified translation partner suggestions), and education. Recent refinements emphasize a minimalist, mobile-responsive, black-and-white UI. New requirements include clearly communicating the platform's self-application purpose, providing visa-specific document and eligibility requirements upfront, and implementing comprehensive responsibility confirmations (with digital signatures) at each critical stage of the application process. Tourist visa (B-1/B-2) support was added.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement robust session management for  persistence (though initial fix was reported).
- Finalize the Proactive Owl Tutor implementation, ensuring full integration across wizard pages with all specialized agents for comprehensive validation rules and message prioritization.
- Complete the implementation and integration of the  component to display visa-specific details early in the flow.
- Integrate the newly created responsibility confirmation components and hooks into the respective application stages (Document Upload, Friendly Form, Letter Review, Final Declaration).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical frontend issue: a yellow page error appearing on the  route after the initial Começar Aplicação button click. This problem resurfaced repeatedly, often linked to  and  discrepancies between the  development environment and the public  preview environment. After re-correcting these environment variables to the public URL, the yellow page error persisted. Debugging revealed a System limit for number of file watchers reached error in the frontend logs. Attempts to fix this involved modifying  and simplifying . However, these simplifications proved to be the cause of the yellow page, prompting the user to request a rollback. The AI engineer is currently in the process of reverting the changes made to  to restore its previous working state.
