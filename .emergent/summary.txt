<analysis>
The AI engineer's work focused on progressively enhancing an AI-powered B2C immigration self-application tool. Initially, the Save and Continue Later feature, including user authentication and dashboard management, was completed and validated. A significant part of the work involved implementing the AI processing logic in  and its corresponding backend endpoint. The application flow was refined multiple times: first, to ensure  data was processed by AI before visual review, and later, a major reordering to place  before  to enable AI pre-filling. Key features like visa-specific requirements display () and responsibility confirmations were integrated. Critically, Dra. Paula's expert knowledge was centralized and integrated across all AI agents for improved accuracy. The UI was adapted from yellow to orange accents. Throughout, the engineer debugged various issues, from URL mismatches and missing icons () to backend syntax errors and, most recently, a critical flaw where document validation was using simulated data instead of real AI analysis. The immediate task is to fix this simulation issue.

The application is an AI-powered self-application tool for US immigration, guiding users through a 9-step journey. It supports B-1/B-2, H-1B, and F-1 visas with a minimalist, black-and-white UI with orange accents. Initial requirements included a Save and Continue Later feature with user login/signup and a dashboard. Core functionalities require AI to review and translate a user-friendly form (Portuguese) into official USCIS forms, followed by user authorization and document upload. AI document validation (Dr. Miguel) was enhanced to detect critical errors. A major flow change was requested to pre-fill  from document data extracted by AI, necessitating  before . User requests also included leveraging personal data from initial steps into subsequent forms, automatic address lookup by CEP, integrating Dra. Paula's expert knowledge across all AI agents for accuracy, and enhancing the OspreyOwlTutor with features like visa-specific messages, achievements, proactive tips, real-time document analysis integration, interactive chat, guidance history, and personalization.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where the AI document validation agent (Dr. Miguel) was not correctly identifying errors in uploaded documents. The investigation revealed that the  function in  was using *simulated* data instead of performing a real analysis.

To fix this, the engineer:
1.  Modified  to replace the call to  with a new, real validation function .
2.  Completed the implementation of the  function.
3.  Created a new backend endpoint  in  to handle the actual AI-powered document analysis. This new endpoint is intended to process the uploaded files and return real validation results.

The last action performed was creating this new backend endpoint.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend to activate the new  endpoint and validate the real document analysis.
