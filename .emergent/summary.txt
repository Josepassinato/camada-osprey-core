The trajectory details a complex, multi-phase development effort on an AI immigration application. Initially, the focus was on connecting the app to a custom domain, which was clarified as a non-code task. The project then shifted significantly to address critical bugs: a Dr. Paula AI JSON parsing error, followed by a comprehensive API health check that revealed and fixed four API issues (authentication, session management, case updates, payment initiation).

A full user journey simulation then uncovered further problems with document analysis completeness and Dr. Paula's responses, which were systematically debugged and resolved, often involving iterative mock adjustments and backend fixes. Following this, the application was prepared for production by removing all mock data and meticulously fixing critical authentication inconsistencies, ensuring user sessions and case association worked reliably. Aesthetic changes were then implemented, replacing all yellow/orange colors with blue and substituting IA mentions with sistema across the application, with rigorous verification for code integrity.

Most recently, the I-539 tourist visa extension process was implemented, covering backend enumeration, Owl Agent fields, frontend selection, document requirements, and payment fees. Finally, the developer began implementing an automated weekly visa information update system with administrative approval, which is the current ongoing task.

<product_requirements>
The application, Agente Coruja (Owl Agent), is an AI-powered platform assisting users with the US immigration process, aiming to simplify form-filling and ensure data privacy. Key features include:

*   **Intelligent Questionnaire:** Guides users through a multi-lingual questionnaire using OpenAI GPT-5 for real-time validation and guidance to auto-fill USCIS forms.
*   **Progress Saving:** Users can save progress through continuous navigation or by creating a simple email/password account to return later.
*   **Finalization & Payment:** After completing the questionnaire, users proceed to a Stripe-integrated payment page. Post-payment, they can download the application package as a PDF or have it emailed. Data is deleted after delivery.
*   **I-539 Extension:** Implemented to allow users to apply for a tourist visa extension, following the existing guided questionnaire, payment, and document flow.
*   **Automated Visa Updates (In Progress):** A system is being developed to automatically update visa requirements, rules, processing dates, and visa bulletin information weekly, with an administrative approval workflow before updates go live to users.
*   **Custom Domain:** Users can connect the application to a custom domain (e.g., ), managed via the platform's deployment interface without code changes.

<current_work>
The immediate work is implementing the Sistema de Atualização Automática de Vistos (Automated Visa Update System). This system aims to weekly update visa information, rules, processing dates, and visa bulletin data, with an administrative approval process.

So far, the following steps have been completed:
1.  **Database Structure for Versioning:** The  model in  has been updated to include fields for tracking updates (, ) and a new  model has been defined to store proposed changes.
2.  **Web Scraping and AI Module Creation:** A new file, , has been created to house the logic for web scraping and using AI to detect changes in visa information.
3.  **Admin Panel Endpoints:** New API endpoints have been added to  for managing visa updates, including  (to view/manage updates), , and  (for administrative approval/rejection).

The AI engineer was in the process of starting **Step 4: Creating the React component for the administrative panel**, which will be the interface for reviewing and approving these automated visa updates.
