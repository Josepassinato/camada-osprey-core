The AI engineer's work commenced after an initial setup, with the user requesting a shift from AI Fraud Detection to a disclaimer system for user responsibility and acceptance at each immigration process stage. The engineer successfully implemented this by creating backend endpoints () and a reusable frontend component (), integrating it into key workflow pages like  and . A Social Security Card validator was also implemented. During testing, challenges with MongoDB queries and API rate limiting were encountered and resolved. Subsequently, the user requested comprehensive production readiness (API documentation, Dockerization, CI/CD, Kubernetes configurations), which was meticulously implemented. The latest task involves enhancing the tutor agent for a more intuitive user experience, with the engineer having initiated the backend and frontend components for this improvement.

The application is an AI-powered self-service platform for US immigration, guiding users from visa selection to final package assembly. Core requirements initially focused on system testing, bug fixes across backend and UI, data persistence, and correcting USCIS form upload logic. A critical need was high-precision AI document validation, specifically identifying Tipo de documento incorreto, Nome não corresponde ao aplicante, and Documento Vencido, evolving from Google Document AI to native multimodal vision AI.

The previous engineer successfully implemented native document validation, intelligent USCIS form filling with a Portuguese friendly form, AI completeness validation, and conversion to official English. Subsequent phases included Cover Letter Generation, Final Package Assembly, Workflow Automation, and Production Optimization & Performance.

Recently, the user explicitly requested replacing the AI Fraud Detection system with a disclaimer system at the end of each process stage, and a general one before payment, where the user accepts responsibility for provided information and confirms correctness. The user also specified the disclaimer text: reconheço que todas as informações acima fora fornecidas por mim e são de minha responsabilidade. E aprovo esta etapa de conclusão confirmando que estão corretos.

Finally, the user requested Preparação para Produção Completa encompassing API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI), Docker containers and Docker Compose, CI/CD pipeline setup, and production environment configurations. The most recent request is to make the tutor agent more practical and valuable for lay users.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (React/Vite) and  (FastAPI) components.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****: Central hub. Updated to include new endpoints for , , and . Modified startup events to initialize these new systems. Enhanced FastAPI configuration for automatic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) by adding detailed descriptions and tags to various endpoints (authentication, documents, disclaimer).
-   ****: (NEW) Implements the logic for recording and validating user acceptances for different stages of the immigration process. Includes functions to get disclaimer text, record acceptance, and validate case compliance. Corrected MongoDB query issues and added debug logging.
-   ****: (NEW) Reusable React component for displaying disclaimer messages and capturing user acceptance.
-   ****: (NEW) React hook to manage disclaimer state and interactions across different frontend pages.
-   ****: Modified to integrate the  and ensure user acceptance before final package approval.
-   ****: Modified to display the  after successful document uploads, ensuring user acknowledgment.
-   ****: (NEW) Implements logic for validating Social Security Card information.
-   ****: (NEW) Backend logic for the improved tutor agent, including endpoints for personalized guidance.
-   ****: (NEW) Frontend React component for interacting with the intelligent tutor.
-   ****: Temporarily modified to disable rate limiting for debugging purposes during disclaimer system testing.
-   ** (NEW directory)**: Contains  (script to generate OpenAPI JSON) and  (API documentation).
-   ** &  (NEW)**: Docker configurations for containerizing the backend and frontend applications.
-   ** &  (NEW)**: Nginx configuration for serving the frontend and potentially routing API requests.
-   ** (NEW)**: Defines multi-container Docker application for local development (backend, frontend, MongoDB).
-   ** (NEW)**: Example environment variables for setup.
-   ** (NEW)**: Script for MongoDB initialization.
-   ** (NEW directory)**: Contains  (GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration/deployment) and  (for security scanning).
-   ** (NEW directory)**: Contains Kubernetes manifest files (, , ) for deploying the application.
-   ** (NEW directory)**: Contains deployment and setup scripts (, ).
-   ****: Updated with project overview and setup instructions.
-   ****: (NEW) Checklist for production deployment readiness.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of advanced Machine Learning enhancements (custom models, general, beyond fraud detection or predictive analytics). (Original pending task, not touched after fraud detection was removed).
-   Further refine the Intelligent Tutor System based on user feedback to offer more practical value and guidance.
-   Re-enable and thoroughly test API rate limiting in  after the disclaimer system is fully stable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed the extensive Preparação para Produção Completa phase. This included:
1.  **API Documentation:** Configuring FastAPI in  for Swagger/OpenAPI documentation and adding tags to key endpoints. Created  and .
2.  **Dockerization:** Creating s for both backend and frontend,  for the frontend,  for local orchestration, and  for database initialization.
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Setting up GitHub Actions workflows (, ) for automated testing and deployment.
4.  **Production Environment Configurations:** Creating Kubernetes deployment manifests (, , ) and deployment scripts (, ).
The main  was also updated, and a  was created.

Following this, the user requested to improve the tutor agent to make it more practical for lay users. The AI engineer has initiated this task by:
1.  Creating the backend file  to house the new tutor logic.
2.  Adding new API endpoints for the intelligent tutor in .
3.  Creating the frontend component  for user interaction.
The last action was restarting the backend to apply these changes.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the  component into relevant frontend pages to make the tutor accessible to users.
