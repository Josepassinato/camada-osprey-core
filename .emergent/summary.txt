The AI engineer's work began by confirming the user's intent to enhance the tutor agent using OpenAI. The engineer meticulously reviewed existing backend components (, ) and frontend files (), confirming initialization and existing endpoints. Enhancements included updating backend logic, adding new FastAPI endpoints, and integrating the  component into , , and . Extensive debugging ensued, addressing frontend rendering issues, authentication token discrepancies, and conditional rendering problems by replacing the  component with an enhanced version and implementing fallback states for  and data loading. Visual verification confirmed the tutor's correct appearance and functionality. Subsequently, the engineer addressed a critical user-reported bug in document validation, improving error specificity in  and Dr. Paula's evaluation function. The latest interaction involves investigating the save form filling progress functionality based on user feedback.

The platform is an AI-powered self-service tool for US immigration, guiding users from visa selection to package assembly. Initial requirements focused on system testing, bug fixes, data persistence, USCIS form upload logic, and high-precision AI document validation, evolving to native multimodal vision AI. The previous engineer delivered native document validation, intelligent USCIS form filling with Portuguese friendly form, AI completeness validation, and English conversion. Subsequent phases included Cover Letter Generation, Final Package Assembly, Workflow Automation, and Production Optimization & Performance.

Recently, the AI Fraud Detection system was replaced by a disclaimer system at each process stage, and a general one before payment, requiring user acceptance of responsibility. The disclaimer text is: reconheço que todas as informações acima fora fornecidas por mim e são de minha responsabilidade. E aprovo esta etapa de conclusão confirmando que estão corretos. This was followed by a request for Comprehensive Production Readiness, including API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI), Dockerization, CI/CD, and Kubernetes configurations. The most recent ongoing task is to make the tutor agent more practical and valuable for lay users, and a new request came to verify the save form filling progress functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React/Vite (frontend), Python/FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI/LLM**: Native multimodal AI vision (OCR, classification, data extraction), OpenAI API (GPT-4o), Emergent Integrations.
-   **Web**: JWT (authentication), FastAPI routers, React routing, API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
-   **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Kubernetes (k8s manifests).

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (React/Vite) and  (FastAPI) components.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****: Central hub. Modified to include new API endpoints for the , and its startup initialization. Pydantic models for new tutor functionality were also added.
-   ****: (NEW) Implements the enhanced logic for the tutor agent, providing personalized guidance using OpenAI. This file was further refined during the trajectory.
-   ****: (NEW) Frontend React component for interacting with the intelligent tutor. It was initially created, then completely replaced with an enhanced 5-tab version to improve user experience. Corrections for authentication token () usage and fallback  for unauthenticated access were implemented.
-   ****: Modified to integrate the  component and ensure it is rendered even without login.
-   ****: Modified to integrate the  component and ensure it is rendered even without login.
-   ****: Modified to integrate the  component and ensure it is rendered even without login.
-   ****: Updated to provide more specific error messages for incorrect document types during validation (e.g., distinguishing between CNH/Driver's License and Passport).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of advanced Machine Learning enhancements (custom models, general, beyond fraud detection or predictive analytics).
-   Further refine the Intelligent Tutor System based on user feedback to offer more practical value and guidance (though initial enhancements are complete).
-   Re-enable and thoroughly test API rate limiting in  after the disclaimer system is fully stable.
-   Investigate and potentially fix the save form filling progress functionality as per the latest user request.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully completed two major tasks:

1.  **Enhancing the Intelligent Tutor System:**
    *   **Backend:** The  was refined, and new API endpoints were added to  to support advanced tutor features using OpenAI.
    *   **Frontend:** The  component was significantly upgraded to a 5-tab interface (Orientations, Checklist, Progress, Avoid Errors, Interview). It was integrated into , , and . Extensive debugging was performed to ensure correct rendering, proper authentication token usage (), and handling of unauthenticated users by providing a default  to ensure the tutor always appears. Visual testing confirmed the tutor's appearance and functionality with all tabs.

2.  **Improving Document Validation Specificity:**
    *   **Backend:** The  file was updated, along with Dra. Paula's evaluation function, to provide highly specific error messages when an incorrect document type is uploaded (e.g., detecting a CNH/Driver's License when a Passport is expected), addressing a user-reported bug of generic error messages. This was confirmed working via backend testing.

The current immediate task involves investigating the user's latest request regarding the save form filling progress functionality, as the previous attempts to locate the relevant code were focused on document saving rather than form progress. The engineer is currently trying to locate the specific USCIS form saving endpoints in .
