The AI engineer's work focused on building and refining an AI-powered B2C immigration self-application tool. Key achievements include implementing the 9-step application journey, a minimalist UI, and a multi-agent AI system (Proactive Owl Tutor with Dra. Paula B2C and specialized agents like Dr. Miguel for document validation). Recurring challenges involved URL mismatches and file watcher limits, both resolved. Significant features implemented during this trajectory include fixing a yellow page error on , resolving a 422 error for B-1/B-2 visa case creation, introducing a comprehensive USCIS submission guide, and enhancing the AI document validation agent (Dr. Miguel) to detect critical errors. A major architectural change involved refactoring the application flow to correctly sequence form filling, AI review, and document upload. The most recent work focused on implementing a Save and Continue Later feature, including user login/signup and a dashboard to manage saved applications, with UI and backend infrastructure now in place.

The application is an AI-powered self-application tool for US immigration, guiding users through a 9-step auto-application journey. This includes initial agreement, visa selection, basic data entry, a user-friendly Friendly Form (in Portuguese), AI review and translation to generate official USCIS forms, user authorization, document upload, storytelling, visual review, payment, and final package download with a tutorial. The system utilizes a Proactive Owl Tutor (multi-agent AI) for guidance and deterministic validations. The UI is minimalist, black-and-white, and mobile-responsive. Recent requirements focused on clearly stating the self-application nature, providing visa-specific details, and implementing comprehensive responsibility confirmations. Support for B-1/B-2, H-1B, and F-1 visas was added. Critical updates include providing detailed USCIS submission instructions (signatures, fees, office addresses), significantly enhancing AI document validation for accuracy (e.g., name and type matching, expiry), reordering the application flow to place form filling before document upload (with auto-saving of generated USCIS forms), and enabling users to save application progress via login/signup.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Save and Continue Later feature. This involved creating the frontend components  and , and adding backend endpoints like  to associate cases with user accounts. The frontend  page was modified to include a Salvar e Continuar Depois button and integrate the . The  page was updated to present the  after payment. The  and  pages were enhanced to list and provide access to a user's saved applications, respectively. Additionally, a section on  (the landing page) was added to guide users with saved applications. The latest action involved ensuring all necessary imports (like  from ) were present and restarting services to facilitate testing of this new flow.
