The previous AI engineer successfully developed the US immigration application through several phases. Initially, a problematic Google Document AI integration was replaced with a robust native multimodal vision system for document validation. Following this, an intelligent USCIS form-filling system was implemented, including a Portuguese friendly form with AI-powered completeness validation (Dra. Ana) and conversion to official English. The most recent work involved completing Phase 3 (Cover Letter Generation), Phase 4A (Final Package Assembly), Phase 4D (Workflow Automation), and Phase 4B (Production Optimization & Performance). The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, integrated LLM capabilities (using Emergent LLM Key and then the user's OpenAI key), and resolved critical frontend and backend issues. The trajectory concludes with the engineer initiating Phase 4C (Advanced Analytics & Intelligence), specifically starting the implementation of the AI Fraud Detection system. Each phase involved comprehensive analysis, implementation of new modules, updates to existing code, and thorough testing, demonstrating a structured and problem-solving approach.

<product_requirements>
The application provides an AI-powered self-service platform for US immigration, guiding users from visa selection to package assembly. Initial requirements included system testing, bug fixes (backend, UI, account), data persistence, USCIS form upload logic correction, multi-stage flow verification, and enhanced AI document validation with specific error messages for legibility, expiry, type, and applicant name. A core request was high-precision validation, initially targeted with Google Cloud Document AI, which later evolved into leveraging native multimodal vision AI. The system must detect Tipo de documento incorreto, Nome não corresponde ao aplicante, and Documento Vencido. The work has successfully implemented native document validation, intelligent USCIS form filling with a Portuguese friendly form, AI completeness validation, and conversion to official English. Subsequent phases included Cover Letter Generation, Final Package Assembly, Workflow Automation, and Production Optimization & Performance.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed Phase 4B: Production Optimization & Performance, which included implementing load testing, security hardening, API rate limiting, and database optimization systems. The Production Dashboard () was confirmed as functional. The user then requested to proceed with Phase 4C: Advanced Analytics & Intelligence, which was 90% implemented. The AI engineer performed an analysis of the existing analytics codebase and was in the process of starting the implementation of the remaining components for Phase 4C. Specifically, the very last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer stating the intention to implement the Sistema de Detecção de Fraudes com IA (AI Fraud Detection System) as the first step for Phase 4C.
