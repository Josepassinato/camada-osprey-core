The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining the AI-powered immigration application's document validation system. Initially, efforts were directed at resolving critical backend type errors and dictionary access issues in , , and . A significant refactoring decision, prompted by user feedback, involved migrating from a dual OpenAI (Dr. Miguel) and Google Vision API approach to a streamlined Google Document AI-only validation system. This transition introduced new integration challenges, including incorrect class imports, API call parameter mismatches, and dataclass attribute access issues. Throughout this, the engineer repeatedly debugged frontend display of validation messages, often uncovering deeper backend logic flaws. A recurring problem was  caching old code, leading to frustrating regressions. The goal of delivering accurate, user-friendly validation messages for document type, expiry, and name mismatch remains partially incomplete, with the latest efforts focused on detailed backend logging to pinpoint the current failure point within the refactored Google Document AI pipeline.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered self-service platform for US immigration, guiding users from visa selection to final package assembly. Key features include an Intelligent Document Validator (regex, Translation Gate, classification, cross-document consistency), Interactive AI Cover Letter (Dr. Paula), and Expanded Case Finalizer (audits, Master Packet PDF, checklists). The user's explicit requests included system testing, resolving backend bugs, fixing UI/account issues, ensuring data persistence, correcting USCIS form upload logic (AI-filled, not user-uploaded), verifying multi-stage flows, improving AI document validation with specific error messages for legibility, expiry, correctness of type, and person, and integrating Google Cloud Document AI for high-precision validation (98%+ accuracy). The validation system is expected to detect Tipo de documento incorreto, Nome não corresponde ao aplicante, and Documento Vencido.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React/Vite (frontend), Python/FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI/LLM**: Google Cloud Document AI (OCR, document understanding, specialized processors), Google Cloud Vision API (initially, then replaced), OpenAI API (initially Dr. Miguel, then removed).
-   **Document Processing**: Modular pipeline, specialized validators, document classification (regex/patterns, text-based), OCR.
-   **Web**: JWT (authentication), FastAPI routers, React routing, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (React/Vite) and  (FastAPI).



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****: Main FastAPI application logic.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected  to . Added a new  endpoint. Integrated . Modified  to initially merge issues from  into . Later, this endpoint was refactored to remove OpenAI-based validation, replacing it with direct Google Document AI calls and logical checks. This involved correcting the import of  to , adjusting parameters for  (from  to , , ), and adapting attribute access for  objects (e.g., ). Extensive debug / calls were added to trace execution flow and errors within the  blocks.
-   ****: Orchestrates AI agents and specialized validations.
    -   **Changes**: Multiple fixes were applied to resolve  and  errors by adding  checks before dictionary methods and ensuring  objects were handled correctly. The  variable was initialized at the beginning of  to prevent local variable referenced before assignment errors. Logic was added to explicitly populate  for incorrect document type, name mismatch, and expired documents, ensuring these are collected rather than causing early returns. Debug logs were added.
-   ****: Contains specific document validation logic.
    -   **Changes**:  and  were modified to convert  objects into dictionaries before being returned or accessed, resolving type mismatch issues.
-   ****: Handles Google Cloud Document AI integration.
    -   **Changes**: Found to be using basic Google Vision API OCR. Refactored to integrate the actual Google Document AI API () for specialized document processing, targeting 98%+ accuracy. Implemented  using keyword-based logic for high-accuracy document type detection (e.g., CNH vs. Passport). Improved regex patterns for accurate name extraction from documents. Added debug logs.
-   ****: Page for automated document uploads.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to correctly process and display  received from the backend, ensuring the Observações section is rendered when validation issues are present.
-   ****: Stores test plans and agent communications.
    -   **Changes**: Periodically updated with new backend tasks for testing, detailed test results, identified bugs, and debugging notes throughout the development trajectory.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was intensely debugging the refactored Google Document AI integration. The previous OpenAI-based Dr. Miguel agent was removed, and the focus shifted to solely using Google Document AI and logical validations in  and .

Despite multiple fixes for import errors, incorrect  arguments, and  dataclass access, the system continues to exhibit inconsistent behavior. While the DOCUMENTO VENCIDO validation successfully appeared in one test, other critical validations like Tipo de documento incorreto and Nome não corresponde are still not consistently displayed in the frontend. Furthermore, regressions occurred where the Google Document AI incorrectly classified documents or the system failed to return any issues at all, displaying  and .

The latest attempt involved adding comprehensive  and  calls in  (specifically at the beginning of the  block for Google AI processing and within the  block) to pinpoint the exact point of failure during document analysis and issue generation in the backend. The backend's  frequently reloading stale code has been a persistent hindrance to debugging. The last action was to run a test with a Brazilian passport, and the current state is that no validation messages appeared in the frontend.
