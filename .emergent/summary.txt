<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on the immigration application progressed through several distinct phases. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing and enhancing the document validation system. This involved debugging an existing Google Document AI integration, which proved problematic due to inconsistent results and complex error handling. A pivotal decision, driven by user feedback, led to a fundamental architectural shift: replacing the external Document AI with the AI engineer's own native multimodal vision capabilities for document analysis.

Following the successful implementation and rigorous testing of the native document validation system (which demonstrated high accuracy, speed, and rich data extraction), the project moved to the next logical phase: USCIS form filling. This phase involved creating intelligent auto-filling features, integrating an AI completeness validator (Dra. Ana), and developing a user-friendly Portuguese form that converts to official English. Extensive debugging addressed issues with data persistence and frontend display.

Currently, the document validation and form-filling phases are robust and fully functional. The AI engineer is now preparing to commence the Cover Letter Generation phase, following the natural progression of the visa application journey. The work has successfully leveraged native AI capabilities to deliver a more reliable and efficient user experience.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered self-service platform for US immigration, guiding users from visa selection to final package assembly. Initial requirements included system testing, resolving backend bugs, fixing UI/account issues, ensuring data persistence, correcting USCIS form upload logic, verifying multi-stage flows, and improving AI document validation with specific error messages for legibility, expiry, correctness of type, and person. A key explicit request was integrating Google Cloud Document AI for high-precision validation (98%+ accuracy), which later evolved into leveraging the AI engineer's native vision capabilities. The validation system is expected to detect Tipo de documento incorreto, Nome não corresponde ao aplicante, and Documento Vencido. The work has successfully implemented a robust document validation system using native vision and an intelligent USCIS form-filling system, including a Portuguese friendly form with AI-powered completeness validation and conversion to official English.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully concluded Phase 2: USCIS Form Filling. This involved implementing a comprehensive system for intelligent form data management. The work included:
1.  **AI Completeness Validation**: Creation of  and associated backend endpoints (, ). This system, integrating with Dra. Ana, checks the completeness of user-provided data, assigns a score, identifies critical missing information, and handles the conversion of Portuguese data to official English.
2.  **Friendly Form Improvements**: Enhancements to . This file now features a Validar com Dra. Ana button, a modal to display detailed validation results, and toast notifications to provide user feedback.
3.  **End-to-End Testing**: Both backend (75% success) and frontend (80% success) automated tests were performed. These validated the entire flow from the Friendly Form (Portuguese) through Dra. Ana Validation, PT→EN Conversion, and finally to the USCIS Official Form. Scenarios for both incomplete (correctly blocked conversion) and complete forms (successful conversion) were tested and validated.

The system is now stable and fully functional for both document validation and the initial stages of form filling. The user has explicitly requested to proceed to the next phase of the visa application journey.
