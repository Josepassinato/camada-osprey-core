The trajectory outlines a significant development cycle for an AI-powered immigration application tool. The work began by implementing Phases 2 and 3 of the Intelligent Document Validator, which involved creating new backend modules for field extraction, translation checks, cross-document consistency, and auto-classification. This required extensive modifications to the  and  files. Initial testing revealed critical bugs, such as unregistered API endpoints and duplicate Pydantic models, which were systematically debugged and resolved.

Following the backend enhancements, the focus shifted to fixing user-reported frontend bugs. The first was a non-functional View Details button for certain visas, traced to missing data in the  component. The second was a failed Review Letter button, caused by a frontend state mismatch with the backend API response in .

A major feature enhancement followed: evolving the cover letter module into an interactive, AI-driven workflow. This new flow enables the AI to either ask clarifying questions or directly format a satisfactory letter. This work was interrupted by a critical issue where the  budget was exhausted. The engineer pivoted to integrate the user's personal OpenAI API key, refactoring all AI agent calls (, ) to use the new key.

The final phase involved upgrading the Case Finalizer from an MVP to a full version with PDF merging capabilities. This is the current task, which has encountered import and endpoint duplication errors in  during integration.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered self-service tool guiding users through the US immigration process.

**Core Features Implemented:**
*   **AI-Driven Application Workflow:** A step-by-step process including data entry, document uploads, and cover letter creation.
*   **Intelligent Document Validator (Phases 1, 2, & 3):** An AI agent (Dr. Miguel) validates documents for quality and visa-specific rules using a YAML-based policy engine. Recent enhancements include regex-based field extraction, a Translation Gate for non-English documents, cross-document consistency checks, and automated document classification.
*   **Interactive AI Cover Letter Module (Dra. Paula):** An AI persona assists users with their cover letters. The workflow was upgraded from a simple review to an intelligent, interactive process. If a user's letter is satisfactory, the AI formats it to official standards. If it's incomplete, the AI generates specific questions, uses the user's answers to rewrite the letter professionally, and presents it for final approval before saving.
*   **Case Finalizer (In Progress):** A final module to audit the application, merge all documents into a master PDF package, and generate final instructions. The MVP is being upgraded to a full version with actual PDF generation.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main FastAPI application file defining all API routes.
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified. New endpoints were added for Document Validator Phases 2 & 3. The cover letter endpoints () were completely refactored to support the new interactive Q&A flow. It was updated to integrate the  module, which led to import and endpoint duplication issues that were being fixed. All AI-related endpoints were updated to handle the new OpenAI client logic.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The UI for the AI-powered cover letter feature.
    -   **Changes:** Significantly refactored to support the new interactive workflow. State management was updated to handle questions from the AI, user answers, and the final AI-generated letter for approval. The UI was changed to display questions and the final review card. A bug related to handling the  status was also fixed.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These files define the core logic for the AI agents (Dra. Paula and Dr. Miguel).
    -   **Changes:** Both were refactored to prioritize using a user-provided . The code was updated to use the usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]
              [-o ORGANIZATION] [-t {openai,azure}]
              [--api-version API_VERSION] [--azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT]

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Displays the specific requirements for a selected visa type.
    -   **Changes:** Edited to add placeholder data for several visa types (I-130, I-485, etc.) to fix a bug where the View Details modal would appear empty because the component only had data for a limited set of visas.

<current_work>
The engineer was in the process of implementing the full version of the Case Finalizer feature, upgrading it from the initial MVP. This involved creating a new module, , with functionality for actual PDF merging and document package generation.

The immediate task was debugging the integration of this new module into the main FastAPI application, . The backend testing agent had identified critical issues, including duplicate API endpoints and incorrect import statements () being placed inside functions instead of at the top of the file.

The last actions performed were:
1.  Moving the  import statement to the top of .
2.  Removing the duplicated endpoints that were causing conflicts.
3.  Attempting to restart the backend server to apply these fixes.

The work was paused immediately after initiating the backend: stopped
backend: started command, waiting to see if the fixes resolved the startup errors and made the new Case Finalizer endpoints accessible. The system is currently in a state of active debugging for this feature.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend server and check the supervisor logs to confirm that the fixes to  have resolved the startup errors. Then, re-run the backend tests targeting the Case Finalizer endpoints to verify functionality.
