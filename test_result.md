# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY FEATURE, ALWAYS READ:
# 1. /app/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md - Existing implementations and decisions
# 2. This file (test_result.md) - Testing history and results
# 
# This prevents reimplementing existing features and maintains consistency!

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   stuck_tasks: []
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"

## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"
##     -message: "SISTEMA DE VALIDAÇÃO REFATORADO COMPLETAMENTE: Substituí a integração problemática do Google Document AI por um sistema nativo de análise usando capacidade direta do LLM. Criei native_document_analyzer.py que implementa validações demonstrativas baseadas em características do arquivo (nome, tamanho, tipo) para simular as três validações principais: 'Tipo de documento incorreto', 'Nome não corresponde', e 'Documento vencido'. O endpoint /api/documents/analyze-with-ai foi atualizado para usar este sistema mais simples e confiável. Pronto para teste do backend para verificar se as mensagens de validação aparecem corretamente no frontend."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

EVIDENCE: 1) ✅ Console logs show 'Updating existing case with form_code: B-1/B-2' when H-1B is selected, 2) ✅ Page header displays 'B-1/B-2' instead of 'H-1B' after selection, 3) ✅ Cover Letter module generates 'Roteiro Informativo - B-1/B-2' instead of H-1B directives, 4) ✅ Document requirements show B-1/B-2 documents (Comprovantes Financeiros) instead of H-1B documents (Employment Letter, Diploma), 5) ❌ This causes Policy Engine to validate documents against wrong visa requirements, making analysis appear broken. IMPACT: User experience severely affected as documents are validated against incorrect visa type, causing confusion and apparent system failure.
