# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "ü¶â AGENTE CORUJA FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED WITH ROUTING ISSUE: I have successfully implemented the complete Agente Coruja frontend interface as requested. WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED: 1) ‚úÖ All 6 Core Components Created - OwlSessionManager (React context for session management), OwlProgressTracker (progress indicator with completion %), OwlValidationFeedback (real-time validation with scoring), OwlFieldGuide (contextual field guidance), OwlFormGenerator (USCIS form generation & download), OwlQuestionnaire (multi-step questionnaire), 2) ‚úÖ Complete User Interface - Modern React interface with owl mascot design, multi-language support (Portuguese/English), responsive design with Tailwind CSS, 3) ‚úÖ Backend Integration - All components configured to use existing owl-agent API endpoints, proper error handling and loading states, 4) ‚úÖ Routing Configuration - Added /owl-agent and /owl-agent/questionnaire routes to App.tsx, 5) ‚úÖ Build Success - Frontend builds without errors, all components pass linting. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Despite correct implementation, the /owl-agent route is redirecting to / and showing AutoApplicationStart page instead of the Owl Agent page. This appears to be a routing configuration issue that needs main agent investigation. The components are ready and functional - only the routing needs to be fixed. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate potential routing conflicts or redirect configurations that might be causing /owl-agent to redirect to root."

RESULTS: ‚úÖ ROUTER REGISTRATION FIX CONFIRMED WORKING: 5 out of 6 Phase 2&3 endpoints now accessible (83.3% success rate), no more 405 Method Not Allowed errors, endpoints responding with proper HTTP status codes (200/422 instead of 404/405), ‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE ENDPOINTS: POST /api/documents/classify (HTTP 200 - working), POST /api/documents/extract-fields (HTTP 422 - accessible, needs payload fix), POST /api/documents/analyze-language (HTTP 200 - working), POST /api/documents/check-consistency (HTTP 200 - accessible), POST /api/documents/validate-multiple (HTTP 200 - working), ‚ùå ONLY 1 ENDPOINT STILL INACCESSIBLE: GET /api/documents/validation-capabilities (HTTP 404), ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS CONFIRMED: Phase 2 Translation Gate working perfectly (language detection operational), Phase 3 Document Classifier accessible and functional, Enhanced Policy Engine integration working (multi-document validation operational), Phase 3 Multi-Document Validation processing successfully, ‚úÖ COMPONENT INTEGRATION TEST RESULTS: Translation Gate: 100% working, Document Classifier: accessible and functional, Multi-Document Validation: working with comprehensive analysis, Field Extraction: accessible but needs payload structure fix, Cross-Document Consistency: accessible but needs payload format correction. CONCLUSION: The router registration fix was SUCCESSFUL! Phase 2&3 endpoints are now accessible and the critical 405 Method Not Allowed issue has been resolved. User can now access the new advanced document validation features."

    message: "CRITICAL SECURITY INVESTIGATION COMPLETED - DOCUMENT VALIDATION SYSTEM COMPROMISED: Investigation confirms user report of system incorrectly approving inadequate documents. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) Dr. Miguel validation system is completely broken with ValidationResult errors and str object attribute errors, causing 100% approval fallback for ALL documents regardless of quality/type/authenticity, 2) Policy Engine has configuration errors (language_compliance_weight missing) but still correctly returns FAIL decisions, 3) System approves wrong document types, documents from different persons, expired documents, low-quality documents, and random papers with 100% confidence, 4) All security validations (type, identity, quality, authenticity) are failing. ROOT CAUSE: Critical bugs in Dr. Miguel specialized_agents.py lines 438 (final_confidence undefined) and policy_engine.py missing scoring keys. IMMEDIATE ACTION: Fix Dr. Miguel validation system and Policy Engine configuration - system is currently unsafe for production use. The user report of 85% approval for inadequate documents is actually worse - system gives 100% approval to ANY document."

    message: "üö® PROMPT APRIMORADO DO DR. MIGUEL - AN√ÅLISE FORENSE DE 7 CAMADAS N√ÉO FUNCIONAL! Comprehensive testing of the enhanced Dr. Miguel prompt for advanced forensic document validation reveals CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURES: ‚ùå TESTE 1 (An√°lise Detalhada): 0% completeness, no forensic layers detected, structured data extraction failing, ‚ùå TESTE 2 (Detec√ß√£o Avan√ßada): Wrong document type not detected, no technical analysis, no specific rejection reasons, ‚ùå TESTE 3 (Valida√ß√£o Identidade): Fuzzy matching not working (Jos√© vs Jose), identity validation completely broken, ‚ùå TESTE 4 (An√°lise Temporal): Days remaining calculation not working, expiry detection failing, USCIS validity checks broken, ‚ùå TESTE 5 (Sistema Pontua√ß√£o): Individual scoring components missing (authenticity_score, quality_score, completeness_score all 0), 85% threshold not enforced, ‚ùå TESTE 6 (Extra√ß√£o Dados): Structured data extraction failing, personal_info/document_numbers/dates sections empty. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: 1) Policy Engine Error: 'language_compliance_weight' KeyError causing FAIL decisions, 2) Dr. Miguel Enhanced System Error: 'ValidationResult' object not subscriptable and 'str' object has no attribute 'update' errors, 3) Enhanced forensic analysis not being called due to system errors. TAXA DE SUCESSO: 1/10 tests passed (10% success rate). CONCLUS√ÉO: O prompt aprimorado de 7 camadas existe no c√≥digo mas n√£o est√° funcionando devido a erros cr√≠ticos no sistema de valida√ß√£o. As an√°lises forenses detalhadas, pontua√ß√£o estruturada e extra√ß√£o de dados n√£o est√£o operacionais."
