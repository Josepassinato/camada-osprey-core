# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

IMPACT: Users see filled Portuguese data but empty English translations, creating confusion. TESTED: Case OSP-A56A5926 with complete form data - Portuguese fields display correctly ('Carlos Eduardo Silva Santos', etc.) but English fields show 'Not provided'.

Stages 4-8 (Documents, Story, Friendly Form, Visual Review, Payment) have frontend implementations but require proper case management for full testing. Overall system architecture solid with excellent UI/UX, responsive design, and proper Brazilian Portuguese localization."

    message: "❌ TESTE FINAL VALIDAÇÃO CORREÇÃO MAPEAMENTO VISUALREVIEW - PROBLEMA CRÍTICO IDENTIFICADO: Testei especificamente o caso OSP-B3474AEB (Ana Beatriz Silva) conforme solicitado para validar se a correção personal → personal_information resolveu o bug do VisualReview. DESCOBERTA CRÍTICA: O problema não é apenas o mapeamento de dados, mas uma falha fundamental no carregamento do componente VisualReview. SITUAÇÃO ATUAL: 1) ✅ Backend funcionando corretamente - caso OSP-B3474AEB existe com dados corretos na estrutura personal_information (Ana Beatriz Silva, 25/03/1992, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil, Brasileira, ana.silva@email.com, +5521987654321, Av.

CAUSA RAIZ: Problema não é mapeamento de dados mas falha fundamental no carregamento do componente VisualReview. AÇÃO NECESSÁRIA: Antes de testar se a correção do mapeamento funcionou, é preciso resolver o problema fundamental de carregamento do componente VisualReview. Investigar: erro JavaScript, problema React Router, ou falha na renderização do componente. Após corrigir o carregamento, poderemos validar se a correção personal → personal_information resolve o bug original."

Root cause: /api/auto-application/start endpoint creates cases with user_id=null even when authenticated, preventing dashboard integration. Cases save but don't appear in user dashboard due to missing user association. ❌ COMPLETE USER JOURNEY: AUTHENTICATION DEPENDENCY - End-to-end flow fails due to same authentication bug affecting case creation and user association. RECOMMENDATION: Fix auto-application start endpoint to detect authenticated users and properly set user_id for logged-in users. This will resolve both Save and Continue Later and Complete User Journey issues. Core AI functionality, responsibility tracking, and visa requirements all working perfectly."
